Usecase: OIDC Server project is a REST service that provides a single RESTful endpoint protected by OAuth 2


The following validation done on OIDC Server : 

1) Tested the below API
URI : localhost:8080/greeting

Response
{
    "error": "unauthorized",
    "error_description": "Full authentication is required to access this resource"
}
The above server response says you are not authorized to access the resource:




2. For accessing the protected resource, we need to first request an access token via the OAuth handshake. Request OAuth authorization:

Method: POST
Request URL: http://localhost:8080/oauth/token?username=roy&password=spring&grant_type=password&scope=read write&client_id=clientapp&client_secret=123456
Headers:
Authorization: Type : Basic Authorization
Username : clientapp
Password : 123456



Response Payload:
{
"access_token": "5cebb80e-ece5-4292-b793-17937d7a3ea1",
"token_type": "bearer",
"refresh_token": "1397f2a1-dec6-48bd-a478-29881f06096a",
"expires_in": 40755,
"scope": "read write"
}


3. Use the access_token returned in the previous request to make the authorized request to the protected endpoint:

Method: GET
Request URL: http://localhost:8080/greeting
Headers:
Authorization : Bearer 5cebb80e-ece5-4292-b793-17937d7a3ea1



Response Payload:
{
"id": 5,
"content": "Hello, Roy!"
}
